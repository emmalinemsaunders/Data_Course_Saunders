1. The process of determining whether or not the predictions have scientific meanings involves first ensuring that predictions fall within a reasonable and plausible range. It also verifies that predicted values align with known biological or experimental constraints (no negative values).

2. The data only shows one non-linear relationship, and that is humidity. I think this is because humidity is a non-numerical category, based mainly on a yes or no answer. Here is a link to a resource explaining how to deal with non-linear relationships in R: https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/introduction-to-non-linear-model-and-insights-using-r
